1-> lexical structure means the format, the way we write the code in any programming language.

3-> keywords in JS 

Public -> to make the class public. 

Static -> to make something not changeable or inheritable.

return -> to return some value to the function 

this -> this is used to specify the variable within the function

implements -> similar like inherited. 

enum -> define set if named constants. 

4-> shorthand operators are the minimilistic operators for different purposes in JS.
eg. 

assignment : x = f()
addition assignment : x+=f() ==> x = x+f()
Division assignment : x/=f() ==> x= x/f()
Exponentiation assignment : x**=f() ==> x = x**f()


5-> The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
